If you haven't heard already, where have you been!? We’re exactly one week away from the [#Hack4Sac](hack4sac.saccounty.net/#mainPage) Kickoff event held at the Sac County Board of Supervisors Chambers. Teams will have 6 weeks to use data from the [Sacramento County Open Data Portal](data.cityofsacramento.org/home) to uncover opportunities and build solutions that will improve our region. A total of $10,000 in cash prizes is up for grabs, as well as the chance to do something great for our city. I don't know about you, but I’m excited about the bright future Sacramento has ahead. We have passionate volunteers and community leaders working to make a lasting impact here. We have government officials that are excited about using technology to enhance civil services. We even have a super easy way for you to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack4sac-kickoff-event-registration-21014497929). All we need now is you; your input, your enthusiasm, your creativity.

Don’t forget, tomorrow night we will have a special guest from the [Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness](www.srceh.org/) with us to talk about developing a digital version of their [People’s Guide to Health, Welfare and Other Services (PDF)](www.sachousingalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Peoples-Guide-FINAL-Englsh-April-22-2014.pdf). You don’t want to miss this one! To RSVP, you can find the event on [Meetup.com](www.meetup.com/Code4Sac/events/227999717/). Hope to see you there!
